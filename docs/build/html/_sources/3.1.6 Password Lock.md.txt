# 3.1.6 Password Lock

## Introduction

In this project, we will use a keypad and a LCD to make a combination lock. The LCD will display a corresponding prompt for you to type your password on the Keypad. If the password is input correctly, "Correct" will be displayed.

On the basis of this project, we can add additional electronic components, such as buzzer, LED and so on, to add different experimental phenomena for password input.

## Code

### For  C  Language

Go to the code folder compile and run.

```shell
cd ~/super-starter-kit-for-raspberry-pi/c/3.1.6/
gcc 3.1.6_PasswordLock.cpp -lwiringPi
sudo ./a.out
```

### For Python Language

```python
cd ~/super-starter-kit-for-raspberry-pi/Python
python 3.1.6_PasswordLock.py
```

After the code runs, keypad is used to input password. If the "CORRECT" appears on LCD1602, there is no wrong with the password; otherwise, "WRONG KEY" will appear.
